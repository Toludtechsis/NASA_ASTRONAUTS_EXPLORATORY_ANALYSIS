# Dreaming Beyond the Stars: A Data Exploration of Astronauts
An exploratory analysis on a kaggle dataset about NASA Astronauts

## Problem Statement
As a child in second grade, I, like many others, dreamed of becoming an astronaut. I vividly remember my picture catalog—where A stood for Astronaut, accompanied by a 3D representation of a space explorer. Without fully grasping what it meant, I was fascinated by the idea of venturing beyond Earth.

Though life led me down a different career path, my admiration for astronauts has only grown. They are highly trained professionals who pilot spacecraft, conduct research, and work in space—one of the most exciting and prestigious careers in the world. Imagine soaring through nebulae, witnessing the brilliance of constellations up close, and floating in zero gravity. Beyond the adventure, astronauts also enjoy some of the highest salaries in the world, making it an enviable profession.

However, like any career, it comes with challenges. Extended time in space can weaken bones, impact blood circulation, and affect mental well-being. Astronauts are also exposed to heightened levels of radiation, posing long-term health risks. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the allure of space exploration remains strong.

This project is a data-driven exploration of astronauts—who they are, where they come from, and what defines their journey. Whether or not I ever make it to space myself, I hope this analysis sheds light on the incredible individuals who do.
All observations and recommendations are based on the datset analysed.

## Insights

#### Comprehensive Insights from the NASA Astronaut Dataset

After data cleaning and analysis, the dataset includes a total of 336 astronauts, comprising 281 males and 50 females. Among them, 46 remain active, 49 are deceased, 206 have retired, and 35 hold management positions.

#### Demographics & Life Expectancy

The average life expectancy of an astronaut is 65 years—67 years for males and 58 years for females. However, given the significantly lower number of female astronauts, these results predominantly reflect male trends.

Astronauts have historically come from various parts of the world, but a majority were born in the United States, particularly in Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

#### Education & Background

Top Undergraduate Fields: The most common undergraduate fields among astronauts are Physics, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.

Top Graduate Fields: At the postgraduate level, astronauts frequently pursued Aeronautical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Medicine, Physics, and Mechanical Engineering.

Advanced Education: A striking 281 out of 336 astronauts held at least a master's degree, highlighting the importance of advanced education in the field.

Top Institutions: The leading alma maters for astronauts include the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, Purdue University, and MIT.

#### Mission Participation & Duration

Astronauts participated in an average of two space flights and one spacewalk, accumulating an average of 1,251 hours (~52 days) in space and eight hours of spacewalking.

Engineering Degrees & Missions: Astronauts with engineering degrees had more mission counts, longer mission durations, and extended spacewalk time. Notably, astronauts with Aerospace Engineering degrees logged 44,401 total mission hours.

Military Training Influence: The institutions producing the most astronauts and longest total mission durations were U.S. Naval Academy (55,289 hours, 45 missions), U.S. Air Force Academy (37,768 hours, 34 missions), and U.S. Military Academy (37,216 hours, 18 missions). This underscores the strong role of military training in astronaut selection.

Notable Civilian Institutions: The highest-ranking non-military school, MIT, contributed 10 astronauts with a total mission duration of 20,106 hours. Purdue University, often called the "Cradle of Astronauts," produced 12 astronauts with 10,658 hours of mission time.

#### Gender-Based Observations

Female astronauts averaged longer mission durations than their male counterparts but logged only half the spacewalk time of men. This may be linked to the types of missions female astronauts were deployed on.

#### Rank & Mission Drafting

Rank vs. Missions: Being a top-ranking astronaut (commander) does not necessarily correlate with being drafted for multiple missions.

Age & Missions: Age does not seem to influence astronaut mission selection. However, most astronauts went on only one mission, except for one astronaut aged 38, who had multiple missions. This astronaut's selection for repeated missions did not appear to be influenced by any specific characteristic.

#### Safety & Mortality Trends

Improved Safety Measures: No fatalities have been recorded among astronauts drafted in recent decades, suggesting that NASA has significantly improved safety protocols over time, leveraging past experiences to prevent mission-related deaths.

Astronaut Life Expectancy vs. Global Average: The average life expectancy of astronauts (65 years) is lower than the global average (typically 72–75 years). This might be due to the physical toll and occupational hazards associated with space travel.

## Key Takeaways

1. Military background plays a crucial role in astronaut selection, with military academies producing the highest number of astronauts and longest mission durations.

2. Engineering degrees are strongly correlated with higher mission counts and longer durations.

3. Advanced education is a common trait among astronauts, though it does not necessarily determine rank.

4. Women spend more time in space per mission than men but have less spacewalking time, likely due to mission type assignments.

5. NASA has improved mission safety, as recent decades have recorded no astronaut fatalities.

6. Despite extensive training, astronauts' life expectancy is lower than the global average, raising questions about long-term health impacts of space travel.

## Recommendations

1. Enhance Civilian Astronaut Pathways
Since military backgrounds dominate astronaut selection, NASA and other space agencies could expand pathways for civilian scientists, engineers, and medical professionals to balance expertise diversity.

2. Encourage More Women in Spacewalks & Leadership Roles
Female astronauts log longer mission durations but fewer spacewalks. NASA could examine the nature of mission assignments to ensure equitable opportunities for women in extravehicular activities and leadership roles.

3. Investigate Long-Term Health Impacts
The lower life expectancy of astronauts compared to the global average warrants further research on post-spaceflight health risks such as radiation exposure, bone density loss, and cardiovascular issues.

4. Leverage Engineering Expertise for Space Missions
Given the strong correlation between engineering degrees and mission participation, space agencies should continue fostering STEM education and support programs that encourage aspiring astronauts from engineering backgrounds.

5. Strengthen Post-Mission Health & Career Support
With many astronauts retiring early, agencies could provide extended health monitoring, psychological support, and career transition programs to ensure long-term well-being.

6. Improve Astronaut Selection Transparency
Since rank and age do not directly impact multiple mission selections, NASA could clarify selection criteria for repeat missions to ensure a diverse and experienced astronaut corps.

7. Expand Safety Innovations
Recent decades have seen no fatalities, indicating major safety improvements. NASA should continue to refine spacecraft designs, radiation shielding, and emergency protocols to sustain this trend.

For aspiring astronauts, the data suggests that having at least a master's degree in a STEM-related field—especially from institutions like the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, Purdue University, or MIT—can significantly improve the chances of being accepted by NASA. Additionally, U.S. citizenship appears to be a strong advantage.

The underrepresentation of women in the field remains a persistent issue. However, aspiring female astronauts should take inspiration from the two Lieutenant Generals in the dataset, one of which is a woman with degrees in Aeronautical Engineering and Aeronautics & Astronautics. This remarkable woman serve as a role model, proving that with determination and skill, dreams of space exploration can become a reality.
