# Dreaming Beyond the Stars: A Data Exploration of Astronauts
An exploratory analysis on a kaggle dataset about NASA Astronauts

## Problem Statement
As a child in second grade, I, like many others, dreamed of becoming an astronaut. I vividly remember my picture catalog—where A stood for Astronaut, accompanied by a 3D representation of a space explorer. Without fully grasping what it meant, I was fascinated by the idea of venturing beyond Earth.

Though life led me down a different career path, my admiration for astronauts has only grown. They are highly trained professionals who pilot spacecraft, conduct research, and work in space—one of the most exciting and prestigious careers in the world. Imagine soaring through nebulae, witnessing the brilliance of constellations up close, and floating in zero gravity. Beyond the adventure, astronauts also enjoy some of the highest salaries in the world, making it an enviable profession.

However, like any career, it comes with challenges. Extended time in space can weaken bones, impact blood circulation, and affect mental well-being. Astronauts are also exposed to heightened levels of radiation, posing long-term health risks. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the allure of space exploration remains strong.

This project is a data-driven exploration of astronauts—who they are, where they come from, and what defines their journey. Whether or not I ever make it to space myself, I hope this analysis sheds light on the incredible individuals who do.

Would you still like to be an astronaut? 


## Objectives
This project explores Astronauts data sourced from Kaggle (NASA astronauts, 1959-2020) 
## Questions
1.How is gender distributed among astronauts?
2.What is the average life expectancy for male and female astronauts?
3.What is the average number of spaceflights and spacewalks per astronaut?
4.What is the average duration (in hours) of spaceflights and spacewalks per astronaut?
5.Which birthplaces are the most common among astronauts?
6.Which academic degrees are most frequently held by astronauts?
7.Which universities have produced the most astronauts?
8.Does an astronaut’s level of education influence their rank?
9.What percentage of astronauts hold top-ranking positions?
10.Does educational background affect the rank of an astronaut?

## Conclusions

After data cleaning, the dataset included a total of 336 astronauts, comprising 281 males and 50 females. Among them, 46 are still in active service, 49 are deceased, 206 have retired, and 35 hold management positions. The average life expectancy of an astronaut was found to be 65 years, with 58 years for females and 67 years for males. Given the significantly lower number of female astronauts, the results predominantly reflect male trends.

Regarding education, the top five undergraduate fields of study among astronauts were Physics, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. For graduate degrees, the most common fields were Aeronautical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Medicine, Physics, and Mechanical Engineering. A striking 281 out of 336 astronauts had at least a master's degree, indicating that advanced education is a common trait among astronauts.

The top five undergraduate institutions attended by astronauts were the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, Purdue University, and MIT. While astronauts come from various parts of the world, a majority were born in the United States, with Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania being the most common birthplaces.

On average, astronauts participated in approximately two space flights and one spacewalk, with 1,251 hours of spaceflight and an average of eight hours of spacewalking. Only 3.8% of astronauts held top-ranking positions, with just one female astronaut amongst them.

Interestingly, educational background did not appear to influence an astronaut’s rank, as most astronauts had at least two degrees,This underscores the extensive training and expertise required for the profession beyond formal education. However, one of the highest-ranking astronauts in the dataset had no degree at all.

## Recommendations
For aspiring astronauts, the data suggests that having at least a master's degree in a STEM-related field—especially from institutions like the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, Purdue University, or MIT—can significantly improve the chances of being accepted by NASA. Additionally, U.S. citizenship appears to be a strong advantage.

The underrepresentation of women in the field remains a persistent issue. However, aspiring female astronauts should take inspiration from the two Lieutenant Generals in the dataset, one of which is a woman with degrees in Aeronautical Engineering and Aeronautics & Astronautics. This remarkable woman serve as a role model, proving that with determination and skill, dreams of space exploration can become a reality.
